# Ubigu custom oskari packages

This repo contains the github actions to build custom oskari core packages.

## Create packages

1. Create a tag with the needed changes in https://github.com/ubigu/oskari-server
2. Create a new release in https://github.com/ubigu/oskari-server-package with same tag name as in `oskari-server`

Creating a release will trigger creation of packages with the tag as the version.
